Introduction
============

Collective Knowledge (CK) is a [community project](http://cKnowledge.org/partners.html)
to develop the supporting technology for collaborative, reproducible and sustainable 
experimentation at [systems, ML, AI and other conferences](http://cTuning.org/ae)
based on agile, DevOps and Wikipedia principles.

CK framework is intended to help researchers and developers:

* share artifacts as portable, customizable and reusable Python plugins with a unified JSON API and meta information (programs, benchmarks, data sets, libraries, tools, predictive models, etc);
* quickly prototype research workflows from shared artifacts (such as [customizable, multi-objective and input-aware autotuning](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01054763) and [crowdsource/reproduce/build upon various experiments](http://cKnowledge.org/repo) across diverse hardware and software stack provided by volunteers;
* make benchmarks and research workflows portable, customizable and adaptable to any platform with Linux, Windows, MacOS and Android using
[CK cross-platform customizable package and environment manager](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows);
* [unify access to predictive analytics](http://cKnowledge.org/ai) (TensorFlow, Caffe, scikit-learn, R, DNN, etc) via unified CK JSON API and CK web service;
* enable reproducible, interactive and "live" articles (see [example](http://cKnowledge.org/rpi-crowd-tuning)); 
* automate [Artifact Evaluation](http://cTuning.org/ae) at systems and ML conferences;
* support open, reproducible and multi-objective benchmarking, optimization and co-design competitions for the whole AI/SW/HW stack (see [ACM ReQuEST tournaments](http://cKnowledge.org/request)).

and [CK use cases](http://cKnowledge.org/use_cases.html) from our [partners](http://cKnowledge.org/partners.html)
including [reproducible ACM tournaments on reproducible SW/HW co-design of emerging workloads](http://cKnowledge.org/request)
and [artifact sharing via ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/docs/reproducibility.cfm).
Join the CK consortium to gradually standardize APIs and meta description of all shared artifacts and workflows!

Minimal installation
====================

The minimal installation requires:

* Python 2.7 or 3.3+ (limitation is mainly due to unitests)
* Git command line client.

### Linux/MacOS

You can install CK in your local user space as follows:

```
$ git clone http://github.com/ctuning/ck
$ export PATH=$PWD/ck/bin:$PATH
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/ck:$PYTHONPATH
```

You can also install CK via PIP with sudo to avoid setting up environment variables yourself:

```
$ sudo pip install ck
```

### Windows

First you need to download and install a few dependencies from the following sites:

* Git: https://git-for-windows.github.io
* Minimal Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows

You can then install CK as follows:
```
 $ pip install ck
```

or


```
 $ git clone https://github.com/ctuning/ck.git ck-master
 $ set PATH={CURRENT PATH}\ck-master\bin;%PATH%
 $ set PYTHONPATH={CURRENT PATH}\ck-master;%PYTHONPATH%
```

### Customization and troubleshooting

You can find troubleshooting notes or other ways to install CK 
such as via pip [here](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Getting-started-guide#Quick_CK_installation).
You can find how to customize your CK installation [here](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Customization).

Getting first feeling about portable and customizable workflows for collaborative benchmarking
==============================================================================================

Test ck:

```
$ ck version
```

Get shared [ck-tensorflow](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-tensorflow) repo with all dependencies:
```
$ ck pull repo:ck-tensorflow
```

List CK repos:
```
$ ck ls repo | sort
```

Find where CK repos are installed on your machine:
```
$ ck where repo:ck-tensorflow
```

Detect available compilers on your machine and register virtual environments in the CK:
```
$ ck detect soft --tags=compiler,gcc
$ ck detect soft --tags=compiler,llvm
$ ck detect soft --tags=compiler,icc
```

See virtual environments in the CK:
```
$ ck show env
```

We recommend to setup CK to install new packages inside CK virtual env entries:
```
$ ck set kernel var.install_to_env=yes
```

Now install CPU-version of TensorFlow via CK packages:
```
$ ck install package --tags=lib,tensorflow,vcpu,vprebuilt
```

Check that it's installed fine:

```
$ ck show env --tags=lib,tensorflow
```

You can find a path to a given entry (with TF installation) as follows:
```
$ ck find env:{env UID from above list}
```

Run CK virtual environment and test TF:
```
$ ck virtual env --tags=lib,tensorflow
$ ipython
> import tensorflow as tf
```

Run CK classification workflow example using installed TF:

```
$ ck run program:tensorflow --cmd_key=classify
```

Now you can try a more complex example to build Caffe with CUDA support
and run classification. Note that CK should automatically detect your CUDA compilers, 
libraries and other deps or install missing packages:

```
$ ck pull repo --url=https://github.com/dividiti/ck-caffe
$ ck install package:lib-caffe-bvlc-master-cuda-universal
$ ck run program:caffe --cmd_key=classify
```

You can see how to install Caffe for Linux, MacOS, Windows and Android via CK
[here](https://github.com/dividiti/ck-caffe/wiki/Installation).

Finally, compile, run, benchmark and crowd-tune some C program (see shared optimization cases in http://cKnowledge.org/repo):
```
$ ck pull repo:ck-crowdtuning

$ ck ls program
$ ck ls dataset

$ ck compile program:cbench-automotive-susan --speed
$ ck run program:cbench-automotive-susan

$ ck benchmark program:cbench-automotive-susan

$ ck crowdtune program:cbench-automotive-susan
```

* [Shared CK deep learning workflows from ReQuEST tournaments](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-results)
* [Shared CK modules (plugins)](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-modules)
* [Shared software detection plugins](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Shared-soft-descriptions)

Trying CK using Docker image
============================

You can try CK using the following Docker image:

```
 $ (sudo) docker run -it ctuning/ck
```

Note that we added Docker automation to CK to help evaluate 
artifacts at the conferences, share interactive 
and reproducible articles, crowdsource experiments and so on.

For example, you can participate in GCC or LLVM crowd-tuning on your machine
simply as follows:
```
 $ (sudo) docker run ck-crowdtune-gcc
 $ (sudo) docker run ck-crowdtune-llvm
```

You can then browse top shared optimization results on the live CK scoreboard: http://cKnowledge.org/repo

Open ACM ReQuEST tournaments are now using our approach and technology 
to co-design efficient SW/HW stack for deep learning and other emerging workloads: http://cKnowledge.org/request

You can also download and view one of our CK-based interactive and reproducible articles as follows:
```
 $ ck pull repo:ck-docker
 $ ck run docker:ck-interactive-article --browser (--sudo)
```

See the list of other CK-related Docker images [here](https://hub.docker.com/u/ctuning).

However note that the main idea behind CK is to let the community collaboratively
improve common experimental workflows while making them 
[adaptable to latest environments and hardware](https://github.com/ctuning/ck/wiki/Portable-workflows),
and gradually fixing reproducibility issues as described [here](http://cknowledge.org/rpi-crowd-tuning)!
